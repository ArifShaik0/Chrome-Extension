# 🚀 Space Shooter - A Timepass Game (Chrome Extension)

**Space Shooter** is a lightweight Chrome Extension designed to keep you entertained while waiting — without distracting you from your original work.  

We often find ourselves switching tabs and forgetting what we were doing whenever there's a **loading screen** or **waiting time**. This extension solves that by giving you a **fun, quick game right in your browser toolbar**.  

No more losing focus. Just click the extension icon, and a **popup game window** will appear — play, pass time, and get right back to your task. 🎮

## 💡 Why This Exists
